This Terraform module allows you to configure and deploy a data lake with multiples GCS 
buckets, lifecycle rules and other features.

## Pre-requisites

??? success "Install Terraform"

    !!! note
        Tested for Terraform >= v1.4.0

    Use tfswitch to easily install and manage Terraform versions:
    ```console
    $ brew install warrensbox/tap/tfswitch
    
    [...]
    ==> Summary
    🍺  /opt/homebrew/Cellar/tfswitch/0.13.1308: 6 files, 10.1MB, built in 3 seconds
    ==> Running `brew cleanup tfswitch`...
    ```
    ```console
    $ tfswitch
    
    ✔ 1.4.2
    Downloading to: /Users/alexis.vialaret/.terraform.versions
    20588400 bytes downloaded
    Switched terraform to version "1.4.2" 
    ```



??? success "Required roles and permissions"

  **On the project you want to deploy on:**

  - Broad roles that will work, but **not recommended** for service accounts or even people.
  - `roles/owner`
  - `roles/editor`
  - Recommended roles to respect the least privilege principle.
  - `roles/pubsub.admin`
  - `roles/storage.admin`
  - Granular permissions required to build a custom role specific for this deployment.
  - `pubsub.topics.create`
  - `pubsub.topics.delete`
  - `pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy`
  - `storage.buckets.create`
  - `storage.buckets.setIamPolicy`
  - `storage.buckets.update`
  

??? success "Log in to GCP with your default credentials"

    !!! warning 
        Look at the below commands outputs to make sure you're connecting to the right `PROJECT_ID`.
  
    ```console
    gcloud auth login
    
    [...]
    You are now logged in as [alexis.vialaret@artefact.com].
    Your current project is [PROJECT_ID]. You can change this setting by running:
    $ gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
    ```
    
    ```console
    gcloud auth application-default login

    [...]
    Credentials saved to file: [/Users/alexis.vialaret/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json]
    These credentials will be used by any library that requests Application Default Credentials (ADC).
    Quota project "PROJECT_ID" was added to ADC which can be used by Google client libraries for billing and quota. Note that some services may still bill the project owning the resource.
    ```

## Deploy the Data lake module on GCP

⚠️ Experimental status: Some steps can be changed for the production step.

=== "One-shot deployment"

    !!! note ""
        This mode of deployment is quicker and easier. It's suitable for projects where the infrastructure is not meant to be managed by Terraform in the long run. Otherwise, prefer the managed deployment workflow.

    Download the standalone `main.tf`:

    ```console
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artefactory/terraform-google-datalake/main/examples/standalone/main.tf
    ```

    ---

    Initialize Terraform:
    ```console
    terraform init
    ```

    ??? info "Output"
        ```console
            Initializing modules...
            - datalake in ../..

            Initializing the backend...

            Initializing provider plugins...
            - Finding latest version of hashicorp/random...
            - Finding latest version of hashicorp/google...
            - Installing hashicorp/random v3.5.1...
            - Installed hashicorp/random v3.5.1 (signed by HashiCorp)
            - Installing hashicorp/google v4.62.1...
            - Installed hashicorp/google v4.62.1 (signed by HashiCorp)

            Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
            selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
            so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
            you run "terraform init" in the future.

            Terraform has been successfully initialized!

            You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
            any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
            should now work.

            If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
            rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
            commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
        ```

    ---
    Open `main.tf` to modify your GCP project ID and the parameters that you want (buckets,
    lifecycle rules etc.)

    ---
    Apply the infrastructure configuration:
    ```console
    terraform apply
    ```

=== "Managed deployment"
    
    !!! info ""
        This deployment mode is meant for Terrafrom power users who already maintain an infrastructure deployment with a remote state. [Install this module and follow the usage documentation.](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/artefactory/datalake/google/latest)

    !!! tip ""
        To keep your infra code clean and concerns separated, we recommend adding the finops module in a standalone file.
    
    ```console
    curl -o datalake.tf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artefactory/terraform-google-datalake/main/examples/standalone/main.tf
    ```
    ```console
    .
    ├── datalake.tf ⬅
    ├── main.tf
    ├── outputs.tf
    └── variables.tf
    ```
    ```console
    terraform init
    ```
